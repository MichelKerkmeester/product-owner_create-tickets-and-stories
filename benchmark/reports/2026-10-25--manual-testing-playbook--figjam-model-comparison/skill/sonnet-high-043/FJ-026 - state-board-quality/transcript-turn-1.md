# FJ-026 turn 1 transcript

**User:** $figjam the Roamstay booking status lifecycle on a new board in our Roamstay Product plan, and colour the end states so support can spot them. Pending until the card is authorised, then Confirmed, which covers Upcoming and In stay. Check-in moves Upcoming to In stay. Check-out ends it as Completed. A guest can cancel while Pending or Confirmed, and the hotel marks No-show after a missed check-in.

Write the board into the existing FigJam file with key <draft-file-key> rather than a new file. That file is in the plan named above.

**Assistant:**

I'll load the Flow skill first.

TYPE AND DIALS\n35\t\n36\t- **Reader question:** which statuses exist and what moves a booking between them? A state diagram\n37\t- **Detai
```

**Assistant:**

Before I draw anything, this is how I read the request.

**Question:** which statuses does a Roamstay booking pass through, and which of them end it?
**Outcome:** support can read every booking status and spot the three that end a booking.
**Reader:** support. **Detail:** balanced. **Audience:** mixed. **Reading distance:** Laptop.

**Outline, in drawing order**
* A booking starts as Pending
* Pending to Confirmed: card authorised
* Confirmed is one section holding Upcoming and In stay, and a booking enters it as Upcoming
* Upcoming to In stay: check in
* Confirmed to Completed: check out
* Pending to Cancelled and Confirmed to Cancelled: guest cancels
* Confirmed to No-show: missed check-in, marked by the hotel
* Completed, Cancelled and No-show each end the booking

That makes 7 states. The remove test cut nothing, because every state and move is in your request. I read it as a state diagram. A table would not show Confirmed holding two statuses or the three ways out.

**Two framings**
* Recommended: a state map with Confirmed as a section. It shows both inner statuses and every exit at once
* The alternative is a flat seven-state map with no section. It costs the "Confirmed covers Upcoming and In stay" grouping and draws cancel twice

**Assumed**
* **Class:** current behavior, because you state the lifecycle flatly and attached no doc. A bookings doc or ticket would settle it, and any line that is a proposal would be labelled as one
* **Where two moves leave from:** check out leaves from In stay and a missed check-in leaves from Upcoming, because a stay cannot end before it starts and a check-in cannot be missed after one. The board shows both as guards on the move out of Confirmed
* **Colour:** the composer draws every state a booking ends from in light gray with a heavy outline, keyed as Final state. Completed, Cancelled and No-show therefore share one colour and are told apart by label. It cannot give Cancelled and No-show a red of their own, and a different colour for either would be a hand edit in FigJam afterwards
* **First glance:** Cancelled, marked with the pink outline, because it is the only end state two moves reach
* **Labels:** In stay and No-show keep your spelling through a description line
* **Title:** Booking status. The subtitle says who reads it and why, and the source line reads "Source: your request"

**Not on the board:** refunds, payment retries, screen detail and any status beyond the seven you named.

**Left out:** what happens to a Pending booking whose card is never authorised, because the request is silent on it.

**Still open:** can a guest cancel while In stay? Confirmed covers In stay, so as written the cancel move leaves the whole section. I recommend drawing it as written and flagging it on a `Finding:` line, because that is what your request says. If cancel is Upcoming only, I would guard it as "from Upcoming".

A yes takes every recommended answer above. Is this the right reading of the board?
