# FJ-022 turn 1 transcript

**User:** $flow how a Fernhouse customer starts a return in the app, on a new board in our Fernhouse Product plan. From the app and the returns doc: the order list, the order detail with a Start a return button, a list of return reasons, a choice between a drop-off point and a courier pickup, and a confirmation with a QR code. Returns are open for 30 days after delivery, after that the app shows Contact support. A free pickup for orders over 100 euros is a proposal under review.

Write the board into the existing FigJam file with key <draft-file-key> rather than a new file. That file is in the plan named above.

**Assistant:**

I'll load the Flow skill files first.

Every path is packet-qualified (`<packet>/references|assets/...`, where `<packet>` is the mode's `mode-registry.json` `packet` field) and converts to the canonical `(workflowMode, leafResourceId)` pair at the one contract boundary, `.skilled/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-skill/scripts/lib/leaf-resource-contract.cjs` in the skills library.

**Assistant:**

Round one of the intake. I'm working from your list of screens and rules, because I haven't seen the screenshots or the returns doc. The rows below are settled so far:

- **Type:** user flow, drawn from the screens a customer passes through and the two choices they make
- **Entry and exit:** the order list is the start. The confirmation with a QR code is the goal, and Contact support is the exit after 30 days
- **Decisions:** the 30 day window after delivery (current behavior) and the drop-off point against courier pickup
- **Left out:** the free pickup for orders over 100 euros. It is a proposal under review, so it stays off the flow and goes on the `Left out:` line
- **Target:** the existing FigJam file `<draft-file-key>`, in the Fernhouse Product plan as you stated. The board goes in as a new section and nothing already on the file changes. I'll read the file once before I ask to write
- **Assumed:** labels use your wording, except Start a return and Contact support, which you quoted. Send the app's exact button text if it differs

**1. Reader and outcome**
Reading: the request describes a customer's path, but no source says who opens the board or what they decide after it.
Question: who reads this board, and what should they be able to decide or do afterwards?
Recommended: a product and support team confirming what a customer sees from the order list to the confirmation, and where the 30 day window ends a return
Why: the 30 day rule and the proposal are the two points those teams need to agree on

**2. What the board must not do**
Reading: you named five screens, one rule and one proposal. Nothing covers what happens after the confirmation, such as the QR scan, the drop-off or the refund.
Question: what should this board leave out?
Recommended: not show the free pickup as current behavior, and not draw anything after the confirmation or before the order list
Why: drawing a proposal as live would misinform the reader, and the flow stays within the nine nodes it needs

**3. Detail, audience and reading distance**
Reading: no source sets these.
Question: which detail level, audience and distance?
Recommended: Balanced detail, Mixed audience, Laptop distance
Why: it keeps every screen and both choices in the app's own words, read by one person at arm's length

Take the recommended answers, or correct any of them?
