**User:** put the launch plan on a FigJam gantt chart

Write the board into the existing FigJam file with key <test-file-key> rather than a new file. If you need a new file instead, create it in the Barter team plan and leave it in drafts, with no project.

No launch plan has been supplied yet. I'm checking how Flow Mode treats an existing file key before I ask you anything.

"## 6. WRITE ROUTES\n\n### Composed route, primary\n\nFlow Mode composes the board itself. `scripts/compose_board.py` reads the checked model and fills `assets/compose-board.js`, and one `use_figma` call runs that code in the file the gate named. The call draws a framed board: the title and the subtitle, the diagram with its zones, every shape sized to its text and coloured by its kind, the routed connectors, a key of every mark the board uses and the source line, all on an 8 pixel grid. It draws every type in Section 3.\n\nThe route is a native MCP connection to Figma's server at `https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`, which Figma's own plugin declares in its root `mcp.json`. The connection comes from that plugin or from the client's connector. Code Mode holds no manual for Figma's hosted server here, and its `figma` manual runs Framelink's `figma-developer-mcp` instead. Whether Figma's OAuth-gated server would admit a Code Mode client is unverified. The vendored `mcp-figma` packet's wiring guide covers that Code Mode path, and its Section 6 records how a headless Claude Code or Codex child reaches the hosted server. The `allowed-tools` frontmatter of this packet names Code Mode as its only MCP tool and no native tool, because the native names depend on the client. Claude Code serves them under the name its config gives the server, such as `mcp__figma-remote__use_figma`. Codex serves them through the Figma app on the ChatGPT account as `figma.use_figma`, and `codex exec` refuses that c

**Assistant:**

I haven't written anything to the board yet. I don't have the launch plan: you didn't attach it, and nothing in this workspace's `context/` folder mentions a launch. A gantt chart takes its tasks, dates, owners and dependencies from the plan itself, and I won't estimate any of those. Nothing has been sent to Figma, and I didn't call `whoami` because every call counts against the monthly allowance.

Please send these in one reply:

**1. The launch plan**
- Reading: no plan was supplied
- Question: can you paste or attach it, or point me to where it lives (a doc, a ClickUp list or a board link)? I need each task, its start and end dates or duration, its owner, what it depends on, and the milestones
- Recommended: paste the plan as it stands, even if it's rough
- Why: any date the plan doesn't give becomes a question, not a guess

**2. Reader and question**
- Reading: nothing yet says who the board is for
- Question: who reads it, and what should they be able to answer from it?
- Recommended: the launch team, answering "what has to happen in what order, and who owns each step, before launch day?"
- Why: that's the question a gantt chart answers best

**3. Outcome and reading distance**
- Reading: nothing supplied
- Question: what should the reader be able to decide after reading it, and where will it be read?
- Recommended: whether launch day is still on track, read on a laptop
- Why: the laptop setting keeps every task without shortening labels

**Target file.** I'll compose the chart in `<test-file-key>`, 400 px to the right of what's already there. Nothing on the board gets moved, edited or deleted. If that file can't be used, the fallback is a new FigJam file in the Barter team plan, left in drafts with no project. Before anything is written, I'll show you a playback of the plan as I've read it, then a separate write gate naming the file and the calls it will use.

HVR self-scan: 0 hard blockers. Fixed: none. Kept with reason: none.
