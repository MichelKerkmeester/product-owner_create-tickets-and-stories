# FJ-001 turn 1 transcript

**User:** $figjam draw the Roamstay checkout payment as a sequence diagram on a new board in our Roamstay Product plan. From the payments brief: the guest app posts the booking, the booking API holds the room, asks the payment provider to authorise the card, confirms the hold, tells the partner hub and answers the app with 201.

Write the board into the existing FigJam file with key <draft-file-key> rather than a new file. If you need a new file instead, create it in the Barter team plan and leave it in drafts, with no project.

**Assistant:**

I'll start by loading the Flow skill.

About 18,000 properties are live, across Europe and the United States.\n\n## Product and surfaces\n\nRoamstay has three surfaces. Each has its own owners and its own release rhythm.\n\n| Surface | Used by | Platforms | Covers |\n|---------|---------|-----------|--------|\n| Guest app | Guests | iOS, Android, web | Search, property page, checkout, trips, account, chat with Guest Support |\n| Partner Hub | Partners | Web, built for desktop | Property profile, rooms, rates and availability, policies, city tax, payouts, bookings list, guest reviews |\n| Back office | Ops agents, Guest Support | Web, staff only | Booking lookup, refunds and rebooking, partner verification, go-live review, payout holds |\n\nWhen a ticket says Guest app without a platform, it means iOS, Android and web together. The web version uses the same services as the apps, but it is built and released on its own.\n\nPartner Hub is where a partner changes what guests see.

**Assistant:**

Before I draw anything, this is how I read the request. Nothing has been written to Figma yet.

**Target.** The board goes into the existing FigJam file `<draft-file-key>` as a new section beside what it already holds, and nothing already on the file changes. That means no new file, so the Barter team plan and drafts fallback isn't used. I can't confirm which plan owns that file. `whoami` lists the plans your account holds, but it doesn't say which one owns a file. I'm reading "Roamstay Product plan" as where the file lives, and I won't create anything in that plan.

**Question:** in what order do the guest app, the booking API, the payment provider and the partner hub exchange messages at checkout? A sequence diagram answers it.

**Outcome (assumed):** the payments and booking engineers can read the checkout calls in order, for a card that is authorised. Your message doesn't name a reader.

**Settled by your summary of the payments brief:**
* The order of the calls
* The 201 that answers the app

The brief itself isn't in the repo, so I'm working from your summary only, and every message below is sourced to it.

**How I'd draw it:** 4 participants and 7 numbered messages, inside the 5 and 12 budget.
1. GuestApp to BookingApi: Post the booking
2. BookingApi to itself: Hold the room
3. BookingApi to PaymentProvider: Authorise the card
4. PaymentProvider to BookingApi: Card authorised
5. BookingApi to itself: Confirm the hold
6. BookingApi to PartnerHub: Booking created
7. BookingApi to GuestApp: 201

**Assumed, because your summary doesn't state it:**
* **Messages 2 and 5:** self-messages on the booking API. Your summary doesn't say another party holds the room.
* **Message 4:** the provider's answer is drawn as a return. You wrote only that the API asks it to authorise.
* **Message 6:** fire-and-forget. You didn't say whether the API waits for the hub before it answers the app.
* **Labels:** written in your words, with no paths. The summary gives no route for the post, and 201 is the only status it states.
* **Scope:** the authorised-card path only. A declined card, a retry and any hub failure are left out, because your summary doesn't cover them. This is what the board must not do: draw a failure path nobody described.
* **Dials:** balanced detail, an engineer audience and Laptop reading distance.

**One conflict.** `context/roamstay-context.md` says only `payments-service` talks to the payment provider, while your summary has the booking API calling it. I recommend the brief governs, because it is the specific source for this flow. If the context file is right, a fifth party sits between messages 3 and 4, and you'd tell me what to call it.

Is this the right reading, and do the assumed items stand as written? Recommended: yes to all, since nothing in your summary points the other way.
