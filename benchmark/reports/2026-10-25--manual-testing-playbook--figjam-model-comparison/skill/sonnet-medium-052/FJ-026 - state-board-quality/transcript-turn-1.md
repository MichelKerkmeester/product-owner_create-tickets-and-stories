# FJ-026 turn 1 transcript

**User:** $figjam the Roamstay booking status lifecycle on a new board in our Roamstay Product plan, and colour the end states so support can spot them. Pending until the card is authorised, then Confirmed, which covers Upcoming and In stay. Check-in moves Upcoming to In stay. Check-out ends it as Completed. A guest can cancel while Pending or Confirmed, and the hotel marks No-show after a missed check-in. The booking doc also says: a booking stays Pending at most 15 minutes while the card is checked. While Upcoming the guest can still change dates, and while In stay the hotel can add charges to the room. A cancel within 48 hours of check-in keeps the first night's price. The hotel can mark a No-show from 6 hours after the check-in time.

Write the board into the existing FigJam file with key <test-file-key> rather than a new file. That file is in the plan named above.

**Assistant:**

Before I draw anything, this is how I read the request so far.

- **Type:** a state diagram, since you're asking which statuses exist and what moves a booking between them.
- **Destination:** a new section in the existing FigJam file `<test-file-key>`, not a new file. I'll read the file once before the write gate so the board lands beside what's already there.
- **Source:** the booking doc as you relayed it, with each line treated as current behavior.
- **Colour:** the composer already draws every end state in light gray with the key entry "Final state", so I can't pick a custom colour. Completed, Cancelled and No-show get that gray automatically. One end state can also take a pink focus outline.

**1. Reader, question and outcome**
Reading: the reader is support, who need to spot the end states.
Question: what question should the board answer, and what should support be able to do after reading it?
Recommended: "Which statuses exist, what moves a booking between them, and which ones are final?" Support can then tell at a glance that a booking is over. Detail level Balanced, audience Mixed, reading distance Laptop. The pink focus outline goes on Cancelled.
Why: the end states are the only part you asked to stand out, and Cancelled is the one with a money rule attached.

**2. What the board must not do**
Reading: your doc lines mix statuses with rules. The 15-minute limit, the date changes, the room charges, the 48-hour rule and the 6-hour No-show window are rules, not statuses.
Question: what should the board refuse to become?
Recommended: not a cancellation or refund policy chart. The rules sit as short lines inside the state they belong to. Pending shows the 15-minute limit, Upcoming the date changes, In stay the room charges, Cancelled the 48-hour first-night rule and No-show the 6-hour window. None of them becomes an extra state or branch.
Why: that keeps it at 7 states and about 11 transitions, so it reads on one screen. The doc doesn't say what happens when Pending passes 15 minutes, so I'd list that under `Left out:` rather than invent an exit.

**3. Cancelling during the stay**
Reading: the doc says a guest can cancel while Pending or Confirmed, and Confirmed includes In stay. I also assume the cancelled status is called Cancelled, since the doc never names it.
Question: can a guest cancel while In stay, or only before check-in?
Recommended: draw it as the doc says, from Confirmed, and name this as an open point in the reply.
Why: limiting it to Upcoming would be my guess, not the doc's.

Take the recommended answers, or correct any of them?
