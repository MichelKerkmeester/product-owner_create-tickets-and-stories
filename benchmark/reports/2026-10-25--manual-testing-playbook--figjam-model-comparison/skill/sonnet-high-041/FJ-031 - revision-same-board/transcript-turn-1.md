# FJ-031 turn 1 transcript

**User:** $flow how a Fernhouse customer starts a return in the app, on a new board in our Fernhouse Product plan. From the app and the returns doc: the order list, the order detail with a Start a return button, a list of return reasons, a choice between a drop-off point and a courier pickup, and a confirmation with a QR code. Returns are open for 30 days after delivery, after that the app shows Contact support. A free pickup for orders over 100 euros is a proposal under review.

Write the board into the existing FigJam file with key <draft-file-key> rather than a new file. That file is in the plan named above.

**Assistant:**

I'll start by loading the Flow skill and its router.

**Assistant:**

Question: which screens does a Fernhouse customer pass through to start a return in the app, and where do they choose? That makes it a user flow.

Outcome: a reader can follow a return from the order list to the confirmation with its QR code and see where the 30 day window ends it.

**What your message settles.** No screenshots or returns doc reached me, so every screen and rule below rests on your wording, and the labels will use it.
* Screens: order list, order detail with Start a return, return reasons, drop-off or courier pickup, confirmation with a QR code. Current behavior, as you state it
* Returns open for 30 days after delivery, then the app shows Contact support. Current behavior
* Free pickup for orders over €100. Proposal, under review

**Placement.** The board goes in as a new section beside whatever the file you named already holds. No new file is created and nothing already there changes.

**Outline.** Seven nodes, seven connectors, read left to right:
* Order list, then Order detail, then "Within 30 days?"
* No leads to Contact support. Yes leads to Pick a reason, then "Drop-off or pickup?"
* Both exits land on Return confirmed, which is the goal

**Look.** I recommend the main line from the order list to the confirmation, with Contact support as the exit beside it. The alternative is a state map of every exit, which adds nodes your sources don't state. Three zones: Find the order, Request the return, Done. Title "Start a return". Balanced detail, mixed audience, Laptop reading distance, all assumed.

**Assumed**
* The 30 day check sits on the order detail, where Contact support replaces the Start a return button. You say only that the app shows it, so a screenshot of an order past the window would settle where
* Both methods go straight to the one confirmation, with no point picker or pickup slot between, because you listed five screens. The doc or screenshots would settle it

**Left out:** free pickup over €100 (proposal), orders not yet delivered (your description gives them no behavior)

Reading: your message names no reader.
Question: who opens this board?
Recommended: the Post-purchase team and anyone writing returns tickets.
Why: the Fernhouse context note gives Post-purchase the returns area, and that audience fits the balanced detail.

Reading: the free pickup is still under review, so drawing it would show it as live.
Question: what must the board not do?
Recommended: leave the free pickup off, name it under Left out, and stop at the confirmation so nothing after the QR code (warehouse check, refund) appears.
Why: the board answers how a return starts.

Reading: the Fernhouse context note, Key flows item 6, dated 2026-09-18, says "There is no self-serve return today" and that customers contact CS. You describe a live in-app flow.
Question: which source governs?
Recommended: your description, treated as current behavior, with the CS path out of scope.
Why: you are working from the app and the returns doc, and the context note is the older of the two. If the flow is not released yet, the title and source line will say so.

Do these readings and the three recommended answers stand?
