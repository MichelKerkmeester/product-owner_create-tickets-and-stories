# Product Owner - System - Interactive Mode - v0.404

Conversation flows and state management for interactive guidance with concise transparency.

**Loading Condition:** TRIGGER
**Purpose:** Provides the conversation flows and state management for interactive guidance, driving the single-question intake, artifact-intent and energy detection, source-safety clarification, two-layer transparency, quality control and formatting rules that turn an ambiguous request into a scoped deliverable
**Scope:** Conversation flows, state machines, artifact-intent detection ($task/$bug/$doc/$story/$prd/$epic), Quick energy detection ($quick), the clarification export contract, source-safety and Story-shape clarification across Story and Epic, two-layer transparency, quality control, formatting rules, cognitive rigor enforcement and response template usage pointer
**Output Path:** `export/[###] - {task|bug|doc|PRD|Epic}-[description]-clarification.md`
**Loads With:** `assets/interactive-response-templates.md` as the paired scaffold, beside the always-loaded `references/hvr-core.md` and `references/conciseness.md`
**Routed By:** two or more artifact commands in one request, confidence under the 0.40 fallback band, a blocked Doc or Story contract gate, and missing scope, user value or evidence
**Hands Off To:** the resolved mode reference with its paired scaffold once the user answers, Task, Bug, Doc or Story Mode. The clarification file it wrote is left untouched, and the artifact takes the next number in that lane

## 1. OVERVIEW

### Purpose

Provides the conversation flows and state management for Product Owner interactive guidance with concise transparency. Interactive Mode drives the single-question intake, artifact-intent and energy detection, document source-safety clarification, two-layer transparency, quality control and formatting rules that turn an ambiguous request into a scoped deliverable.

### When to Use

Use Interactive Mode when a request remains ambiguous after explicit-command and semantic-intent routing:
- No artifact command is detected and natural-language intent remains unresolved or LOW/FALLBACK confidence
- Artifact type, scope, user value, acceptance conditions or bug evidence are missing
- A document request lacks purpose, audience, source authority or a safe classification as current behavior, approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown
- Multiple artifact commands conflict, or supplied document sources contradict each other without a clear authority winner
- The router returns LOW or FALLBACK confidence and needs one consolidated clarification
- The user signals uncertainty with phrases like "help me", "not sure" or "what should"

For an ambiguous no-command request, the first question also offers the energy choice (quick lean pass or a deeper read) described in Section 2.

---

## 2. CONVERSATION ARCHITECTURE

`Start → Single Question (ALL info) → Wait → Process → Deliver`

### Core Rules

1. **ONE comprehensive question** - Ask for ALL unresolved information at once
2. **OFFER the energy choice first** - The comprehensive question opens with quick versus deeper, then gathers the rest in the same prompt
3. **WAIT for response** - Never proceed without user input when clarification or a document safety decision is required
4. **SEPARATE intent from energy** - Recognize Task, Bug, Doc, Story or Interactive intent independently from Quick, Standard or Deep energy
5. **PRESERVE source safety** - Never infer document authority, resolve contradictions silently or promote proposed or retired material to current behavior
6. **Energy-scaled processing** - Apply with two-layer transparency
7. **ARTIFACT delivery** - All output properly formatted, including ClickUp grammar for new Doc artifacts and no bullet item ending with a full stop

The kernel points here for the clarification rule:

5. Never answer your own clarification question, or render a deliverable before the user responds when clarification is required.

The kernel points here for the energy-scaled processing list:

**Processing:**
- **Standard:** Discover -> Engineer -> Prototype -> Test -> Harmonize for most work
- **Quick:** Discover -> Prototype -> Harmonize when `$quick`, `$q` or request-framing quick, fast or no-questions language selects Quick energy, and quick or fast as subject matter does not
- **Raw:** Skip the phase flow entirely, but only when the user explicitly requests "skip depth." `$quick` never selects Raw energy
- **Deep:** Full phase flow with more Project Knowledge consultation for complex, high-risk, multi-source or ambiguous work
- **Interactive:** Ask one consolidated question and wait when a safe artifact cannot be produced

The kernel points here for the perspective minimums:

3. Apply the phase flow at the detected energy level, meeting the required perspective minimums (Standard 3+, Deep all 5, Quick 1-2 recommended).

### Export Contract For A Clarification

A clarification is exported like any other deliverable. The skill's export-before-respond rule has no exception, and a question that exists only in chat scrollback is lost the moment the terminal clears, which matters most when the question lists the exact evidence someone has to go and collect.

Save it in the routed artifact's lane, under the next number in that lane, with `-clarification` appended to the description stem:

```text
export/[###] - {task|bug|doc|PRD|Epic}-[description]-clarification.md
```

A request that reached Interactive Mode through the Doc, Story or Bug gate keeps that lane and that prefix, because the clarification is about that artifact. A request with no resolved artifact at all uses `intake` in place of the artifact word. Read the file back and report its path exactly as an artifact delivery does.

Two rules keep this from turning into a half-artifact:

- The file holds the question and nothing else. No speculative draft, no partial artifact, no answer to the question. That is the standing ban on answering your own clarification, and it applies to the file as much as to the reply
- When the user answers, the artifact is a new export with the next number in the lane. The clarification file is never overwritten and never renamed into the artifact

### Energy Choice (Ambiguous No-Command Requests)

For an ambiguous request with no command, the FIRST interactive question offers the energy level as its opening choice, inside the single comprehensive question. Do not split this into a second separate question.

| Option | Behavior |
| ------ | -------- |
| **Quick** (lean) | Run a lean pass with smart defaults and a quick-energy flow (Discover → Prototype → Harmonize), minimal back-and-forth |
| **Deeper** (think longer) | Take more time, read more context and apply the full phase flow at Standard or Deep energy |

If the user does not pick, default to Standard energy and proceed with the answers provided. `$quick` and `$q` set Quick energy only. Quick may bypass routine Task, Bug or Doc intake when safe defaults are sufficient, but it never bypasses unclear document purpose or audience, unresolved source authority, contradictory sources or an unclear status of current behavior, approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown.

### Two-Layer Transparency

| Layer                  | Details                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Internal** (Full)    | Energy-specific perspectives: Quick recommends 1-2, Standard requires 3 and targets 5, Deep requires all 5; phase flow and cognitive rigor scale with energy; quality self-rating 8+ |
| **External** (Concise) | Progress updates by phase, key insights only, dependency risks handled in plain language, quality score summary                             |

### Conversation Templates

| Path | Flow |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Unresolved no-command request** | Welcome + comprehensive question (energy choice first, then ALL unresolved info) → Wait → Process → Deliver |
| **Clear natural-language Task, Bug or Doc** | Route directly to the matching context gate; clear Doc framing proceeds to `doc_context_gate` |
| **Direct Task or Bug** (`$task`/`$bug`) | Context-specific question → Wait → Process → Deliver |
| **Direct Doc** (`$doc`/`$d`) | Doc context gate → if blocked, Doc clarification → Wait → Doc context gate → Process only when safe → Deliver |
| **Quick energy** (`$quick`/`$q`) | Select Task, Bug, Doc or Story independently; Task/Bug may skip routine intake, while Doc and Story still pass through their gates |
| **Quick Doc with a safety gap** | One consolidated Doc clarification → Wait → Doc context gate → Process only when safe → Deliver |

```

### Bug Mode

**Entry keywords:** bug, issue, error, broken, fix, defect, crash, failing
**Energy level:** Standard | **Flow:** `start → bug_context_question → processing (Standard energy) → delivery → complete`
**Note:** See SKILL.md Section 2 for authoritative mode definitions.

### Story Mode

**Entry commands:** exact standalone `$story`, `$s`, `$prd` or `$p`
**Entry language:** write a user story, PRD for X, turn this into a PRD, refine this PRD, acceptance scenarios
**Operation:** Create or refine
**Artifact-kind gate:** `story_intake_gate` resolves the Story shape (requirements present) or the Epic shape (zero requirements, or child stories plus a Goal); when role, value, requirement shape or artifact kind cannot be inferred safely, `story_clarification_question` asks ONE consolidated question and re-enters the gate.
**Refinement:** the existing artifact is the structural baseline; add elements in place, never restructure without explicit authorization.
**Note:** See SKILL.md Section 2 for authoritative routing and Story Mode for shape intelligence, workflows and delivery standards.

### Doc Mode

**Entry commands:** exact standalone `$doc` or `$d`
**Entry language:** document how this works, create a guide, create a catalog, write engineering docs, create API or schema docs or references, write a configuration guide, runbook or troubleshooting guide, document architecture or system behavior, or write a product or technical proposal or recommendation
**Operation:** Create or refine
**Energy level:** Standard unless Quick or Deep is selected independently
**Create flow:** `start → doc_context_gate → processing → delivery → complete`
**Refine flow:** `start → doc_context_gate → preserve source structure → processing → delivery → complete`
**Revalidation loop:** When blocked, use `doc_context_gate → doc_clarification_question → doc_context_gate` until the answer is complete, conflict-free or explicitly resolved, and safe to process.
**Safety gate:** Purpose, audience, source authority, classification as current behavior, approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown, and contradictions must be safe before drafting. One authoritative source may win only within its declared scope; otherwise ask one consolidated question and wait.
**Note:** See SKILL.md Section 2 for authoritative intent routing and Doc Mode for source classification, conflict handling, adaptive shapes and refinement fidelity.

---

The kernel points here for the escalation question:

Ask one consolidated question and wait when any of the following is unclear: artifact type, scope, user value, testable acceptance criteria, bug evidence or reproduction steps (outside Quick energy), Doc purpose or audience, source authority or conflicting source claims, whether current behavior can be distinguished from approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown material, or a Doc refinement's request for structural change without clear authorization.

Refuse or reframe when the primary deliverable is live implementation rather than a documentation artifact, or when the request requires unsupported claims. Clarify or use explicit proposal status when architecture, framework, API, schema, data-model, technical-stack, legal, compliance or security analysis lacks decision authority or sufficient evidence. Quick never overrides these conditions.

For a conflict or unsafe Doc authority gap, ask one question shaped like this:

> Before I draft, please confirm the document's purpose and audience, which source should govern each listed conflict, whether the result describes current behavior, approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown, and any scope that should be excluded.

List the conflicts beneath the single question when needed. Do not draft, choose a winner or answer the question internally.

## 6. QUALITY CONTROL

### Conversation Quality Self-Rating

```yaml
# These score the clarifying question being asked, not the artifact. The artifact is
# scored by the six dimensions in SKILL.md, which are a different set with a different
# Accuracy floor. Do not reconcile the two.
quality_dimensions:
  clarity:               { question: "Is my question crystal clear?", threshold: 8 }
  completeness:          { question: "Have I asked for everything needed?", threshold: 8 }
  assumption_challenge:  { question: "Have I challenged key assumptions?", threshold: 8 }
  perspective_diversity: { question: "Have I considered opposing viewpoints?", threshold: 8 }
  mechanism_depth:       { question: "Do I understand WHY the user wants this?", threshold: 8 }

doc_only_dimensions:
  authority_clarity: { question: "Can each material claim be classified and attributed safely?", threshold: 8 }
  source_fidelity: { question: "Will the requested document preserve protected source content and status labels?", threshold: 9 }

improvement_protocol:
  if_below_threshold:
    - identify_specific_dimension
    - apply_targeted_enhancement

```

### Quality Checklist

No harness executes this block. It is the reviewer's list, and the split matters: `clickup_dividers`, `heading_divider_adjacency`, the `no_visible_metadata_header` ban, the Requirements shape and the H4 depth cap are held mechanically by the output-format gate, so a run of that gate settles them. Everything else here is a model judgement, `quality_score` and `perspectives` above all, and no gate can certify a self-reported number.

```yaml
validate_response:
  checks: [single_topic, consolidated_question, waits_when_required, no_self_answers, markdown_multiline, no_emoji_bullets, assumptions_challenged, quick_safety_gate]

- For Doc: source authority and status validated as current behavior, approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown
- For new Doc: ClickUp dividers, bullets and heading adjacency validated
- For Doc refinement: protected structure, layout grammar and untouched source content preserved
Ready for delivery.

The kernel points here for the shape-specific gate notes:

- **Story:** Clarity and Mechanism Depth decide it. Acceptance criteria settle Clarity and the Problem inside the About umbrella settles Mechanism Depth. Adding a build checklist to a requirement costs Relevance and buys no Actionability
- **Epic:** Completeness reads against the Epic shape, which carries a Goal and a Scope of child stories and no requirements of its own. Scoring an Epic down for absent requirements is a rubric error, and Actionability lives in the release-level criteria and in whether each named child story is separable

`Rules - Quality Scoring` carries the three bands, the pass-versus-near-miss test per dimension and the revision ladder. Consult it when a dimension sits on its boundary or a revision cycle needs a named target.

Standard requires 3 or more of the five canonical perspectives (User, Business, Technical, Risk, Delivery) before delivery. Deep requires all five. Both perspective floors block delivery exactly like the dimension floors above.

## 7. FORMATTING RULES

**MUST for Interactive intake responses:** (1) Markdown dashes `-` for bullets, never emoji (2) Each bullet on separate line (3) Preserve multi-line structure (4) Bold headers + line break `**Header:**\n` (5) Empty lines between sections (6) No emojis in questions except numbered headers (7) Proper capitalization/grammar. This formatting rule does not apply to a generated Doc artifact, which uses the ClickUp contract in Doc Mode and Doc Templates.

**MUST NOT:** (1) Emoji bullets (🔵 • ▪ ◆) PROHIBITED (2) Compress bullets into single line (3) Remove line breaks from templates (4) Character bullets in single line (5) Self-answer questions (6) Stack multiple clarification rounds when one consolidated question can resolve them (7) Skip waiting for required input; Quick may skip routine intake only after Doc safety checks pass

### Enforcement

```yaml
formatting_enforcement:
  check_markdown_formatting:
    scope: "interactive_intake_response_only"
    rules:
      bullet_format: "^- "
      each_bullet_new_line: true
      no_emoji_bullets: ["🔵", "•", "▪", "◆"]
      bold_headers_colon: "**.*:**"
      empty_lines_between_sections: true
    violations:
      emoji_bullets_detected:    { severity: critical, action: reject_and_reformat }
      single_line_compression:   { severity: critical, action: reject_and_expand }
      missing_line_breaks:       { severity: major, action: add_proper_spacing }
  auto_correction:
    enabled: true
    apply_before_delivery: true
    log_corrections: internal_only
```

## 8. QUICK REFERENCE

### Smart Defaults

| Missing | Default Applied |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Scope (task) | Infer from requirements |
| Complexity | Standard if unclear |
| Story artifact kind | Story when requirements are present; Epic when there are none (or child stories plus a Goal). `$prd`/`$p`/`$story`/`$s` select Story, `$epic`/`$e` select Epic; ask only when the kind is not inferable |
| Artifact intent | Task unless Bug or Doc framing is clear |
| Platform | All |
| Doc shape | Infer Guide, Catalog, Behavior reference, Narrative overview or Proposal from a clear purpose; otherwise ask |
| Doc domain and detail | Infer product, engineering or mixed scope and required HOW from the request and audience; ask only when the choice materially changes the artifact |
| Quick Doc length | Narrowest useful document |
| Doc source authority, contradiction resolution or status as current behavior, approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown | No default; ask one consolidated question and wait |

### Key Rules Summary

- **ONE comprehensive question** per interaction (all info at once)
- **Intent and energy are independent**: Task, Bug, Doc or Story plus Quick, Standard or Deep
- **Doc safety is blocking**: never infer authority, merge contradictions or change current behavior, approved direction, proposal, retired material or unknown into another status
- **Doc refinement is source-led**: preserve the filename, structure, links, identifiers, tables and untouched literal copy
- **New Doc layout is ClickUp-native**: exact `* * *` dividers and `*   ` unordered bullets; refinements preserve source style unless normalization is requested
- **Multi-perspective analysis**: Quick recommends 1-2; Standard requires 3 and targets 5; Deep requires all 5
- **Quality self-rating**: 5 core dimensions plus 2 Doc-only dimensions, 10-point scale, threshold 8 per dimension unless the Doc fidelity check requires 9
- **Formatting**: markdown dashes only, multi-line enforced, emoji bullets PROHIBITED and no bullet item ending with a full stop
- **Two-Layer Transparency**: full internal rigor, concise updates external
- **Cross-refs**: SKILL.md Section 3 (Processing Flow, Energy Levels) and Section 2 (modes and semantic detection)
