## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** product-owner/019-runtime-and-project-optimization/009-routing-research-fixes
**Level:** 2
**Status:** In Progress
**Date:** 2026-10-21
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the P1 findings, When the phase closes, Then each is fixed or recorded with a reason | implementation-summary.md Findings table, P1 rows | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the P2 findings, When the phase closes, Then each is fixed or recorded with a reason | implementation-summary.md Findings table, P2 rows | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the gates, When rerun from the final state, Then each passes | implementation-summary.md Verification | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.
