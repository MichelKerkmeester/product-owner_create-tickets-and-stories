## Phase Context

This is **Phase 10** of the extension fixes under the Product Owner FigJam flow generation upgrade.

**Scope Boundary**: sk-create-figjam/scripts/figjam_checks/flowchart.py and fixtures.py.

**Dependencies**:
- The finding in `../../016-figjam-improvement-research/research/research.md` Section 9.

**Deliverables**:
- The edited sources, their Project mirrors where they have one, and passing gates.

**Changelog**:
- When this phase closes, refresh the matching file in ../changelog/ using the parent packet number plus this phase folder name.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The repeated-label rule is checked by hand only, and a model with four connectors labelled then passes.

### Purpose
The user-flow and process check fails four or more identical labels on non-decision edges.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Sk-create-figjam/scripts/figjam_checks/flowchart.py and fixtures.py

### Out of Scope
- Any other ranked change, which has its own phase
- Any Barter screenshot, Barter flow or board URL

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| sk-create-figjam/scripts/figjam_checks/flowchart.py and fixtures.py | Modify | The user-flow and process check fails four or more identical labels on non-decision edges |

## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| REQ-001 | The user-flow and process check fails four or more identical labels on non-decision edges. |
| REQ-002 | Every gate passes after the change: run_gates.sh, the format gates, the playbook validators and the Sync Loop gates where a mirror changed. |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| REQ-003 | The edit was proposed by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash at max through cli-pi and applied and checked by the orchestrator. |

> Acceptance criteria for these requirements live in `acceptance-criteria.md`,
> which is the document that decides whether this packet may close.

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: flow_check.py fails the four-then model and its self-test passes with the new planted model.
<!-- /ANCHOR:success-criteria -->

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Risk | Parallel edits collide in a shared file | Med | Edits apply in order and a failed match is redone by hand |
| Risk | A mirror drifts from its source | Med | Mirrors are regenerated or edited with the source and the parity gates run |

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## L2: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: No secrets, board URLs or Barter flows in any edit.

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: The pre-change tree is snapshotted, so the change reverts file by file.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## L2: EDGE CASES

### Error Scenarios
- A proposed edit whose old text no longer matches: redone by hand against the current file.

### State Transitions
- Partial completion: the snapshot restores any file.
