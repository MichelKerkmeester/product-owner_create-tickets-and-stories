# Acceptance Criteria: Phase 16: Decide screen against state by the action that reaches it

<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .skilled/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** product-owner/017-figjam-flow-generation/031-round-three-apply/016-screen-or-state
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-10-21

## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the change is applied, When the files are read, Then the change from the input to model logic rank 5 synthesis is in place: a pair whose changed area sits inside one region is one screen in two states, and a pair that differs across the viewport is two screens. A state earns a node only when a different action reaches it or a reader can be trapped in it, and otherwise the detail goes in the label and under `Left out:`. The four shapes stay as they are | Applied to sk-create-figjam/references/flow-mode.md, sk-create-figjam/references/types/user-flow.md: a pair whose changed area sits inside one region is one screen in two states, and a pair that differs across the viewport is two screens. A state earns a node only when a different action reaches it or a reader can be trapped in it, and otherwise the detail goes in the label and under `Left out:`. The four shapes stay as they are | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the final tree, When every gate runs, Then each passes | On the final tree run_gates.sh printed all 12 gates pass, the format gate passed across 70 source files at the 38 baseline advisories, reference parity was byte-identical, the playbooks passed at 51 scenarios with 0 warnings and 48 scenarios at the 37 baseline warnings, the topology check passed, the three skill packages validated, the plugin rebuilt to 375 files and validates, the flow_check self-test passed 154 of 154, the router passed 141 of 141 fixtures and 219 of 219 differential inputs, check_hub passed 37 gold rows, and in the scratch clone the Sync Loop parity passed 62 of 62 and Product Owner residency passed | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the worker's edits, When they are applied, Then each was checked against the current file before it landed | Reviewed against the operator's rule that every question carries the AI's reading and a recommended answer and never dead-ends. Its Screenshots bullet was combined into phase 14's edit at the shared anchor | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Closeable:** Yes

Every row is Met with the evidence named in its Verification cell.
