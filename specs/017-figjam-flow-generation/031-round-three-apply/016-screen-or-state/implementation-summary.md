## What Was Built

Decide screen against state by the action that reaches it. A pair whose changed area sits inside one region is one screen in two states, and a pair that differs across the viewport is two screens. A state earns a node only when a different action reaches it or a reader can be trapped in it, and otherwise the detail goes in the label and under `Left out:`. The four shapes stay as they are.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| sk-create-figjam/references/flow-mode.md | Modified | Decide screen against state by the action that reaches it |
| sk-create-figjam/references/types/user-flow.md | Modified | Decide screen against state by the action that reaches it |

## How It Was Delivered

A read-only DeepSeek V4.1 Flash worker at max through cli-pi on llmgateway proposed exact edits as JSON. The orchestrator reviewed them, applied them with a script that refuses missing or repeated old text and hand-mirrored or regenerated the Project files. Nothing is committed.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Apply the ranked change as the synthesis words it | The operator adopted all thirty-two changes |
| Every question states a reading and a recommendation | The operator's rule for this phase outranks the research's rule that the reader and the question are never assumed |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| The change | Applied to sk-create-figjam/references/flow-mode.md, sk-create-figjam/references/types/user-flow.md: a pair whose changed area sits inside one region is one screen in two states, and a pair that differs across the viewport is two screens. A state earns a node only when a different action reaches it or a reader can be trapped in it, and otherwise the detail goes in the label and under `Left out:`. The four shapes stay as they are |
| Review of the worker's edits | Reviewed against the operator's rule that every question carries the AI's reading and a recommended answer and never dead-ends. Its Screenshots bullet was combined into phase 14's edit at the shared anchor |
| Gates on the final tree | On the final tree run_gates.sh printed all 12 gates pass, the format gate passed across 70 source files at the 38 baseline advisories, reference parity was byte-identical, the playbooks passed at 51 scenarios with 0 warnings and 48 scenarios at the 37 baseline warnings, the topology check passed, the three skill packages validated, the plugin rebuilt to 375 files and validates, the flow_check self-test passed 154 of 154, the router passed 141 of 141 fixtures and 219 of 219 differential inputs, check_hub passed 37 gold rows, and in the scratch clone the Sync Loop parity passed 62 of 62 and Product Owner residency passed |

## Known Limitations

1. No live board has been written, so the change is untested against the hosted Figma MCP until it is connected.
