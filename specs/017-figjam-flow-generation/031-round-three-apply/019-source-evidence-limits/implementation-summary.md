## What Was Built

Name what each source can and cannot evidence. One line per input type names the item kinds it can evidence. A ticket evidences an error or exit node and not the move into it, a criterion's When evidences an edge, a reaction evidences an edge. A trigger with no evidence becomes an unknown trigger.

## How It Was Delivered

A read-only DeepSeek V4.1 Flash worker at max through cli-pi on llmgateway proposed exact edits as JSON. The orchestrator reviewed them, applied them with a script that refuses missing or repeated old text and hand-mirrored or regenerated the Project files. Nothing is committed.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Apply the ranked change as the synthesis words it | The operator adopted all thirty-two changes |
| Every question states a reading and a recommendation | The operator's rule for this phase outranks the research's rule that the reader and the question are never assumed |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| The change | Applied to sk-create-figjam/references/flow-mode.md: one line per input type names the item kinds it can evidence. A ticket evidences an error or exit node and not the move into it, a criterion's When evidences an edge, a reaction evidences an edge. A trigger with no evidence becomes an unknown trigger |
| Review of the worker's edits | Reviewed against the operator's rule that every question carries the AI's reading and a recommended answer and never dead-ends. The evidence rule gained the recommendation sentence, and a trigger no source states is drawn on the recommended trigger, marked assumed, with Unknown trigger kept for a move the AI has no reading for. Its Screenshots bullet went into phase 14's combined edit |
| Gates on the final tree | On the final tree run_gates.sh printed all 12 gates pass, the format gate passed across 70 source files at the 38 baseline advisories, reference parity was byte-identical, the playbooks passed at 51 scenarios with 0 warnings and 48 scenarios at the 37 baseline warnings, the topology check passed, the three skill packages validated, the plugin rebuilt to 375 files and validates, the flow_check self-test passed 154 of 154, the router passed 141 of 141 fixtures and 219 of 219 differential inputs, check_hub passed 37 gold rows, and in the scratch clone the Sync Loop parity passed 62 of 62 and Product Owner residency passed |

## Known Limitations

1. No live board has been written, so the change is untested against the hosted Figma MCP until it is connected.
