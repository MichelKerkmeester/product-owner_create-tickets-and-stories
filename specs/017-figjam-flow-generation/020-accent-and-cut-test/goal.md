## 1. DURABLE DIRECTIVE

**Objective:** The accent goes to the one node a reader would keep, a tie splits the diagram, and every node serves the userIntent sentence or is cut.

### Decisions

Frozen choices. Changing one is an amendment.

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | The change is the one phase 016 ranked, adopted by the operator on 2026-10-20 with all twelve |
| D2 | A read-only DeepSeek V4.1 Flash worker at max through cli-pi on llmgateway proposes the edits, and the orchestrator applies and checks them |
| D3 | Every changed source with a Project mirror is mirrored by the SYNC.md parity method, and the kernel stays at the unreleased v1.2.2 |

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## 3. COMPLETION CRITERIA

- [x] The rubric and the style guide carry the accent test and the cut test, and their Project mirrors match
- [x] run_gates.sh prints all gates pass on the final tree
- [x] The format gates and the playbook validators pass on the final tree
- [x] validate.sh --strict on 020-accent-and-cut-test prints RESULT: PASSED

## 4. LOG

Everything below is VOLATILE. It is not part of the directive, it is not copied
into the objective, and it is expected to grow. Progress, evidence, deviations
and findings belong here.

### Progress

| Item | State | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Phase opened | Done | 2026-10-20, a child of 017 |
| Change applied | Done | quality-rubric.md carries the accent test, the tie that splits and the userIntent cut test, style-guide.md places the accent on the node the diagram exists to explain, and the regenerated Knowledge mirrors differ from the sources only by the generator's known transforms |
| Gates | Done | run_gates.sh all 12 gates pass. Both format gates pass on 70 source files with 38 advisory warnings, the baseline count. reference-parity.cjs byte-identical. The playbook validator passes 47 scenarios with 0 violations and topology 9 of 9. validate_skill_package.py --strict passes on the hub and both packets, leaf-manifest.json is fresh, the plugin rebuilds to 370 skill files and validates. In the scratch clone run_parity passes 62 of 62 pairs and run_residency passes for Product Owner |
| Strict validation | Done | validate.sh --strict on this folder printed RESULT: PASSED |
