# Acceptance Criteria: Phase 22: Created node tags

<!-- HVR_REFERENCE: .skilled/skills/sk-doc/sk-create-with-human-voice/references/hvr-rules.md -->

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** product-owner/017-figjam-flow-generation/022-created-node-tags
**Level:** 2
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-10-20

## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Given the change is applied, When the files are read, Then the tag step, its fallback and the operator's metadata ruling are written, and no claim says the tag call is verified live | flow-mode.md Sections 5, 6 and 9 and hybrid-workflow.md carry the tag step after the read-back, the namespace with the diagram's name and a run id, the wrapped calls and the tag-aware rollback. The text says `use_figma` may refuse `setPluginData` and claims no live proof. The operator's ruling that metadata is allowed is recorded | Met | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | Given the final tree, When every gate runs, Then each passes | run_gates.sh all 12 gates pass. Both format gates pass on 70 source files with 38 advisory warnings, the baseline count. reference-parity.cjs byte-identical. The playbook validator passes 47 scenarios with 0 violations and topology 9 of 9. validate_skill_package.py --strict passes on the hub and both packets, leaf-manifest.json is fresh, the plugin rebuilds to 370 skill files and validates. In the scratch clone run_parity passes 62 of 62 pairs and run_residency passes for Product Owner | Met | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | Given the worker's edits, When they are applied, Then each was checked against the current file before it landed | The worker wrote that `use_figma` refuses `setPluginData`, which no source proves, so both places were softened to may refuse | Met | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is
`Waived` or `Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in
`decision-record.md`. A waiver naming an ADR that is not there fails validation:
the point of a waiver is that someone recorded the reasoning, so an unbacked
waiver is treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.
