## 1. DURABLE DIRECTIVE

**Objective:** Where the server reports whoami, the packet resolves the plan before the gate and asks when there are several.

### Decisions

Frozen choices. Changing one is an amendment.

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | The change is the one phase 016 ranked, adopted by the operator on 2026-10-20 with all twelve |
| D2 | A read-only DeepSeek V4.1 Flash worker at max through cli-pi on llmgateway proposes the edits, and the orchestrator applies and checks them |
| D3 | Every changed source with a Project mirror is mirrored by the SYNC.md parity method, and the kernel stays at the unreleased v1.2.2 |

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## 3. COMPLETION CRITERIA

- [x] flow-mode.md calls whoami conditionally before the gate
- [x] run_gates.sh prints all gates pass on the final tree
- [x] The format gates and the playbook validators pass on the final tree
- [x] validate.sh --strict on 025-plan-whoami prints RESULT: PASSED

## 4. LOG

Everything below is VOLATILE. It is not part of the directive, it is not copied
into the objective, and it is expected to grow. Progress, evidence, deviations
and findings belong here.

### Progress

| Item | State | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Phase opened | Done | 2026-10-20, a child of 017 |
| Change applied | Done | flow-mode.md Section 6 calls `whoami` before the gate where the server reports it, names one plan in the gate and turns several into one question, and Section 9 does the same before asking. The Flow Mode mirror says the same in connector terms |
| Gates | Done | run_gates.sh all 12 gates pass. Both format gates pass on 70 source files with 38 advisory warnings, the baseline count. reference-parity.cjs byte-identical. The playbook validator passes 47 scenarios with 0 violations and topology 9 of 9. validate_skill_package.py --strict passes on the hub and both packets, leaf-manifest.json is fresh, the plugin rebuilds to 370 skill files and validates. In the scratch clone run_parity passes 62 of 62 pairs and run_residency passes for Product Owner |
| Strict validation | Done | validate.sh --strict on this folder printed RESULT: PASSED |
