# FJ-024 -- Architecture board quality

This document captures the user-testing contract, execution flow, source anchors and metadata for `FJ-024`.

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

This scenario validates architecture board quality for `FJ-024`. It checks that a written architecture places every part in its layout lane, draws asynchronous calls dotted and lets a fresh reader trace a request.

### Why This Matters

An engineer reads an architecture by tracing one request across it. Parts in the wrong lane or async calls drawn solid send that trace down the wrong path.

## 2. SCENARIO CONTRACT

Operators run the exact prompt and command sequence for `FJ-024` and confirm the expected signals without contradictory evidence.

- Objective: Verify that a written architecture places every part in its layout lane, draws asynchronous calls dotted and lets a fresh reader trace a request
- Real user request: `draw the services behind Loomlist block sync as a FigJam architecture diagram on a new board in our Loomlist Engineering plan: desktop, web and iOS clients, an API gateway, sync-service, a push worker, the blocks database, file storage, a change stream and Apple's push service. Clients hold a live socket to the gateway, sync-service writes every block change and publishes it to the change stream, and the push worker reads the stream and wakes sleeping iOS devices.`
- Prompt: `draw the services behind Loomlist block sync as a FigJam architecture diagram on a new board in our Loomlist Engineering plan: desktop, web and iOS clients, an API gateway, sync-service, a push worker, the blocks database, file storage, a change stream and Apple's push service. Clients hold a live socket to the gateway, sync-service writes every block change and publishes it to the change stream, and the push worker reads the stream and wakes sleeping iOS devices.`
- Expected execution process: Open with the playback, which waits for its own yes and comes after an intake round only when the run opens one. Then pick the architecture, assign the six lanes, cut file storage by name, check, stop at the gate naming one composed board in six lanes, compose on the gate's yes and read back
- Expected signals: Turn 1 ends on the playback and writes nothing. Turn 2 ends on the gate and writes nothing. Turn 3 writes after the gate's yes. The board holds 9 of 9 nodes, 8 of 8 connectors and 6 of 6 lanes, with the three event edges dotted. No node carries a fill the model set, the dotted edges stay distinct in the greyscale copy, and the reply names file storage under `Left out:`. The scorecard totals at least 18 of 22, with Composition, Fidelity, the four Hygiene checks and Reply at full marks and no scored dimension at 0
- Desired user-visible outcome: A board that reads in its planned order at both zooms, with every count measured
- Pass/fail: PASS if the board quality scorecard in the root playbook Section 3 totals at least 18 of 22, Composition, Fidelity, the four Hygiene checks and Reply score full marks and no scored dimension scores 0. FAIL if any count differs from the model, a composed node moved, the reply misstates a count, a dimension scores 0, a point lost names no location or no fix or the total is under 18. Anything written before the gate's yes also fails it. Record SKIP only when the hosted Figma MCP is unavailable in this environment, naming that blocker

## 3. TEST EXECUTION

### Prompt

- Prompt: `draw the services behind Loomlist block sync as a FigJam architecture diagram on a new board in our Loomlist Engineering plan: desktop, web and iOS clients, an API gateway, sync-service, a push worker, the blocks database, file storage, a change stream and Apple's push service. Clients hold a live socket to the gateway, sync-service writes every block change and publishes it to the change stream, and the push worker reads the stream and wakes sleeping iOS devices.`

### Recommended Orchestration Process

1. Restate the user request in plain user language
2. Run it locally in one fresh session, because each scenario reads one runtime's replies and tool calls
3. Execute the steps exactly as written
4. Compare the observed output with the desired user-visible outcome
5. Record the verdict with the evidence below

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Scenario Name / Objective | Exact Prompt | Exact Command Sequence | Expected Signals | Evidence | Pass/Fail Criteria | Failure Triage |

Confirm nothing is written. If the run opens an intake round first, answer it with the recommended answers and confirm the playback follows` -> 3. `user: Yes, that reading is right. -> operator: confirm the passing check and the gate, with nothing written yet` -> 4. `user: Yes, go ahead. -> operator: record the reply, every tool call and each get_figjam read` -> 5. `operator: write down the glance order the model plans, then screenshot the whole board and the diagram at 100% zoom and copy the reading one in greyscale` -> 6. `operator: score Composition, Crossings, Shared trunks, Label collisions, Fidelity, Legibility and Signal, and name a location and a fix for each point lost` -> 7. `operator: score the four Hygiene checks against the first and last read and score Reply` -> 8. `reader: give a fresh reader the two colour screenshots and ask Q1 to Q3 -> operator: score Clarity and total the scorecard` | Turn 1 ends on the playback and writes nothing.

When Fidelity or Reply lost points, compare the model, the read-back and the reply line by line against `references/flow-mode.md` Sections 7 and 8 2. When Composition lost points, compare the overview with the planned glance order and name the part that arrives early or late 3. When Crossings, Shared trunks, Label collisions or Legibility lost points, check whether the model caused it, such as declaration order or a long label, before recording it as composer behavior 4.

### Expected

Turn 1 ends on the playback and writes nothing. Turn 2 ends on the gate and writes nothing. Turn 3 writes after the gate's yes. The read-back counts 9 of 9 nodes, 8 of 8 connectors and 6 of 6 lanes, with the three event edges dotted. The overview reads in the planned glance order. The reader answers from the two colour screenshots. Q1: Which part do the clients connect to? Answer: the API gateway. Q2: How does a sleeping iOS device find out about a change? Answer: sync-service publishes to the change stream, the push worker reads it and calls Apple Push. Q3: Which connections do not wait for an answer? Answer: the three dotted ones: publishes, consumes and the Apple Push call. Every score is recorded with the evidence that set it, and every point lost names its location and its fix

### Evidence

Every reply, every tool call with its arguments, each get_figjam read, the planned glance order, the overview screenshot, the reading and greyscale screenshots, the reader's answers and the scorecard with one reason, one location and one fix per score

### Pass / Fail

- **Pass**: the board quality scorecard in the root playbook Section 3 totals at least 18 of 22, Composition, Fidelity, the four Hygiene checks and Reply score full marks and no scored dimension scores 0
- **Fail**: any count differs from the model, a composed node moved, the reply misstates a count, a dimension scores 0, a point lost names no location or no fix or the total is under 18. Anything written before the gate's yes also fails it. Record SKIP only when the hosted Figma MCP is unavailable in this environment, naming that blocker

### Failure Triage

1. When Fidelity or Reply lost points, compare the model, the read-back and the reply line by line against `references/flow-mode.md` Sections 7 and 8
2. When Composition lost points, compare the overview with the planned glance order and name the part that arrives early or late
3. When Crossings, Shared trunks, Label collisions or Legibility lost points, check whether the model caused it, such as declaration order or a long label, before recording it as composer behavior
4. When Clarity lost points, name the question the reader missed and the node or label that misled them
